# 3D Printable Radius Gauges

An [OpenSCAD]() model for 3D-printable radius gauges for any radius of your
chosing. The radius as well as gauge dimensions can be adjusted in OpenSCAD to
suit your needs.

These were inspired by a model I saw on Thingiverse, but for whatever reason is
no longer there. They can gauge inside and outside corner or semi-circular
forms.
